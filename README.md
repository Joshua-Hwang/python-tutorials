# python-tutorials
 A set of slides to help teach Python.


# Preamble
## Who you are
In actuality these slides have been made specifically for a friend of mine.

I assume the reader has no programming experience and is starting from a
highschool level knowledge base.
Any can pick these slides up.

## What this doesn't teach you
These tutorials are with the intent to teach Python and purely Python.
These lessons will not attempt to teach programming in general.

I must say this explicitly because there are certain features and conveniences
that Python provides which are rare in many other languages.


## What we hope you get out of these lessons
In my opinion, learning to program is valuable **if** you're able to make use
of it in your day-to-day. Programming and script writing should be so quick and
effortless that you're able to do it as easily as you write a formal e-mail.

Thus, the goals is to be able to do the following:
* Create scripts that can move and filter a large amount of files
* Scrape websites for information of images
* Automate your everyday processes
* Use Python as a complicated calculator
* Parse and handle data from a file
